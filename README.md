Playing with sinatra and D3

## What have I learned
In order to use JS libraries and frameworks like angular, D3, etc. some of your routes have to return JSON which will be used by JS framework in another route (that happens via AJAX) - take a look at views/home.slim for such an example.

## To run the application 
bundle exec rackup -p 3000
This will run on port 3000 on the local machine.
